# Kinross Apartments Ticketing System

## **Project Description**  

The Kinross Apartments requires an efficient ticketing management system to streamline the maintenance of the apartments.  
Currently, the process is done manually. Whenever a resident reports an issue, the lease office staff record the problem details in an Excel sheet and assign the tasks manually to a maintenance team member.  
This process makes it difficult for the lease office staff to keep track of the status of reported issues, and sometimes the issues remain unresolved for several days.  

The ticketing system should be user-friendly and efficient.  

- Lease office staff should be able to provide access to residents, and residents should be able to raise tickets.  
- Tickets must be assigned to the appropriate maintenance staff member.  
- Maintenance staff should be able to see the problem details, resolve the issue, and update the ticket status.  
- If the resident is not satisfied with the solution, lease office staff should be able to reopen the ticket.

## **User Stories**  

1. As a resident, I want to raise maintenance tickets so that issues in my apartment can be resolved efficiently.  
2. As lease office staff, I want to assign tickets to maintenance staff so that reported issues are addressed promptly.  
3. As maintenance staff, I want to update ticket statuses so that all stakeholders are informed about the resolution progress.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

### **User Story 1: Raise a Ticket**  

- A resident can create a ticket with mandatory fields like issue description and apartment number.  
- The system prevents the submission of tickets with missing mandatory fields.  
- The system sends a confirmation notification to the resident after ticket submission.  
- Duplicate tickets for the same issue cannot be created within a set timeframe.  

### **User Story 2: Assign a Ticket**  

- Lease office staff can view all open tickets in a list.  
- Tickets can be assigned only to active and available maintenance staff members.  
- The system sends notifications to both the staff and the assigned maintenance personnel upon assignment.  
- The ticket status updates to "Assigned" after successful assignment.  

### **User Story 3: Update Ticket Status**  

- Maintenance staff can access and view tickets assigned to them.  
- Ticket statuses can be updated to "In Progress" or "Resolved" with relevant notes.  
- The system requires maintenance staff to add resolution notes when closing a ticket.  
- Notifications are sent to the lease office staff and the resident upon ticket resolution.
